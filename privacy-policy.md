Memento mori is an open source Chrome extension to show a life calendar as the "New tab" page in Chrome.

The life calendar is a block of text on the page with an "X" for each week already lived, and a "." for each remaining week. 
The calendar is based on the configured date of birth and life expectancy.

## Stored data

Memento mori stores the following data using the [chrome.storage API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/) 

- date of birth
- life expectancy in years 

If Chrome Sync is enabled, this data will automatically be synced to any Chrome browser that the user is logged into.

This data is not sent to any 3rd parties or stored anywhere other than within Chrome's storage.

The user can choose to enter any date of birth and any life expectancy value.
